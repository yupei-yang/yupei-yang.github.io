I am now a Ph.D student at [Center for Cognitive Machines and Computational Health](http://cmach.sjtu.edu.cn/) (CMaCH), [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Shikui Tu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~tushikui/) and [Prof. Lei Xu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lxu/). I am fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/) at [Halicioğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) at [UC, San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/). Before joining SJTU, I got my B.Sc. from Chien-Shiung Wu College at Southeast University, China (2018 – 2022), working with [Prof. Shaofu Yang](https://sfyangcs.github.io/).
