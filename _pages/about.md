I am now a Ph.D student at [Center for Cognitive Machines and Computational Health](http://cmach.sjtu.edu.cn/) (CMaCH), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of [Prof. Shikui Tu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~tushikui/) and [Prof. Lei Xu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lxu/). I am fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/) at [Halicioğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) at UC, San Diego (UCSD). Before joining SJTU, I got my B.Sc. from Chien-Shiung Wu College, Southeast University (SEU), working with [Prof. Shaofu Yang](https://sfyangcs.github.io/) (2018 – 2022).
